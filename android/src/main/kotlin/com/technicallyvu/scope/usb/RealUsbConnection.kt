/**
 * [UsbConnection] over the Android USB Host API.
 *
 * Bulk IN reads are **pipelined**, not synchronous. [UsbDeviceConnection.bulkTransfer] submits one
 * URB per call and returns when it completes, so between one transfer completing and the next being
 * submitted (a JNI round trip plus our per-read coroutine dispatch) nothing at all is queued on the
 * endpoint. The i4season endoscope has a small FIFO and simply drops rows while the host is not
 * asking: measured on a Galaxy Z Fold 7 (Android 16), *every* frame arrived truncated
 * (`framesPartial` climbing ~11/s at 10.9 fps), while the desktop libusb backend — same driver, same
 * 16 KB reads, but asynchronous transfers — lost about one frame in six. The vendor app uses queued
 * asynchronous transfers for the same reason.
 *
 * So each bulk IN endpoint gets a lazily created pool of [QUEUE_DEPTH] [UsbRequest]s, each with its
 * own direct [ByteBuffer] of exactly the length the caller asks for. A read waits for the next
 * completion via [UsbDeviceConnection.requestWait], copies the bytes out and immediately re-queues
 * that request, so the endpoint always has requests outstanding and the device never stalls on us.
 *
 * OUT endpoints keep the plain synchronous path: they only carry the useeplus driver's short
 * commands, where latency does not matter and queueing would only add complexity.
