# USB Scope privacy policy

**Effective date:** 13 September 2026
**Applies to:** USB Scope for Android and USB Scope for Windows, published by TechnicallyVu (Anthony Vu)
**Contact:** anthony@technicallyvu.com

USB Scope is a viewer for USB endoscope and borescope cameras. It shows the camera's live picture and saves
photos and video clips when you ask it to. It does not collect, store, transmit, sell or share any personal
data. This page explains that in the detail app stores and privacy laws ask for.

## The short version

- The app has **no internet access**. On Android it does not request the INTERNET permission, so the
  operating system will not let it open a network connection at all.
- The app requests **no permissions**. Not camera, not microphone, not location, not contacts, not storage,
  not notifications.
- There is **no account**, no sign-in, no analytics, no crash reporting, no advertising and no third-party
  software development kit of any kind inside the app.
- Everything the app produces stays **on your device**, in files you own and can delete.

## What the app does with your data

### The camera picture

The endoscope sends its picture over the USB cable. The app decodes it and shows it on screen. Frames are
kept in memory only for as long as they are needed to display them (and, if you have noise reduction turned
on, to blend with the next frame). They are not written anywhere unless you take a snapshot or record a
clip.

### Photos and clips

When you tap Snapshot or Record, or use the cable button, the app writes a JPEG or MP4 file to your
device's normal media storage, in an album called **USB Scope**. On Android this goes through the system
media store, which is why the app needs no storage permission; the files appear in your Gallery like any
photo. On Windows they are written to the folder you chose. The files contain the picture, the time they
were taken and an orientation tag. They contain no location and no identifying information beyond what is
visible in the picture. You can view, share or delete them with any other app; USB Scope never reads them
back.

### Settings

Your preferences (noise reduction, sharpening, the cable-button timing, vibration, keep-screen-on, whether
the statistics overlay is shown, whether you have dismissed the tips, and the remembered rotation or
mirroring for each camera model you have used) are stored in a small private file on the device. They are
not synced or backed up by the app and are removed when you uninstall it.

### USB device information

To recognise your camera the app reads the identifiers the device itself reports over USB (vendor and
product number, and for some models a short name and firmware version). These describe the camera model,
not you. They are shown on screen when relevant and are not stored anywhere except as the key for the
per-model rotation setting above.

### Nothing else

The app does not read your contacts, calendar, location, phone state, clipboard, other apps, or any file it
did not create. It does not run in the background when you are not using it and starts only when you open it
or plug in a supported camera.

## Links that leave the app

The About screen contains two links: one to the project's source code and one to a donation page at
ko-fi.com. Tapping either opens the address in your normal web browser. Nothing is sent from the app;
once you are in the browser, the privacy policy of that website applies. You can use every feature of
USB Scope without ever tapping them.

## Children

USB Scope is a general-purpose tool and is not directed at children. Because it collects no data, it
collects no data from children either.

## Your rights

Privacy laws such as the GDPR and the CCPA give you rights over personal data a company holds about you.
TechnicallyVu holds none from this app, so there is nothing to access, correct, export or delete on our
side. Anything the app produced is in files on your own device and under your control.

## How you can verify this

- The app is open source under the MIT licence. Anyone can read the code and rebuild it.
- The Android build fails on purpose if the INTERNET permission ever appears in the app's manifest.
- The About screen in the app lists the number of permissions requested (zero) and the sensitive permissions
  it specifically does not have.
- On Android, Settings → Apps → USB Scope → Permissions shows "No permissions requested".

## Changes to this policy

If a future version of the app ever changes what it does with data, this page will be updated, the effective
date at the top will change, and the app's release notes will say so. The current version of this policy
always lives at https://technicallyvu.com/usb-scope/privacy and in the project's source repository.
