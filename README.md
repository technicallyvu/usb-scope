# USB Scope

Privacy-first, open-source viewer for cheap USB endoscopes that ship with untrusted vendor apps.
The full privacy policy is in [docs/privacy-policy.md](docs/privacy-policy.md): no permissions, no network, no data collected.
First supported device: USB 2CE3:3828 / 0329:2022 endoscopes. Verified on hardware in the `i4season-yuv`
personality (single interface, YUYV); the `useeplus` personality (dual interface, MJPEG) is implemented
from public protocol documentation and has not been exercised on a device here.

Phase 1 = Windows dev bench. See `docs/superpowers/specs/` for the design and `docs/windows-setup.md`
for the one-time WinUSB driver step.

## Quick start (Windows)
    .\gradlew.bat :core:test                       # protocol tests
    .\gradlew.bat :desktop:probe --args="--list"   # what libusb can see
    .\gradlew.bat :desktop:run                     # the viewer

## Prior work
Protocol documentation reimplemented from: hbens/geek-szitman-supercamera (CC0),
echase/ProbeView (MIT), MAkcanca/useeplus-linux-driver (GPL-3, reference only),
jmz3/EndoscopeCamera, NinesLastGoal/supercamera_WIN10.

## Hardware-free development
    .\gradlew.bat :desktop:run --args="--replay core/src/test/resources/fixtures/i4season-yuv-320x240.upkt"

## Supported devices
| Driver | USB IDs | Layout | Picture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `i4season-yuv` | 2CE3:3828, 0329:2022 | one interface FF/F0/01 | 320x240 YUYV, ~11 fps (verified on hardware) |
| `useeplus` | 2CE3:3828, 0329:2022 | interfaces FF/F0/00 + FF/F0/01 | 640x480 MJPEG (from public docs; untested here) |
| `uvc-bulk` | any | USB Video Class, bulk streaming endpoint | MJPEG or YUY2 at the camera's default frame (unit-tested only; no UVC hardware yet; isochronous cameras are refused with a message) |

## Status
Phase 1 (Windows dev bench) accepted 2026-09-09 against an i4season "su4p-002" (2CE3:3828, firmware 5.0.13).
Phases 2, 3a and 3b followed; next is launch prep (see `docs/next-steps.md`).

## Android (Phase 2)
    .\gradlew.bat :android:assembleDebug            # builds; fails if any dependency adds the INTERNET permission
    C:\platform-tools\adb.exe install -r android\build\outputs\apk\debug\android-debug.apk

Plug the endoscope into the phone; Android offers to open USB Scope. Photos go to Pictures/USB Scope and clips to
Movies/USB Scope through MediaStore, so the app requests no system permissions at all. (The trust screen reports
"Permissions requested: 0". The merged manifest does contain one app-private signature permission injected by
AndroidX for its own broadcast receivers — it is defined by the app, granted only to the app, invisible to every
other app, and is not a system permission; the count excludes it and says so in a footnote.) Debug builds add a
developer sheet — replay the bundled capture without hardware, log per-second frame timing under the tag
`ScopeViewModel`, copy diagnostics — reached by a long-press on the version line in About. Requires the Android SDK
(compileSdk 37, targetSdk 36, minSdk 29); see `docs/dependencies.md`.

Phase 2 accepted 2026-09-10 on a Galaxy Z Fold 7. Notes: `docs/phase2-notes.md`, then `docs/phase3b-notes.md`.

### Screens
- **Live view** — full screen, black letterbox. A status chip (connection dot, state, fps) top-left, a REC badge
  with elapsed time top-right, and a translucent sheet of eight controls along the bottom: snapshot, record,
  rotate, mirror, denoise, stats, settings, about. The sheet fades after four seconds without a touch while
  streaming and comes back on a tap; the REC badge never fades. On a Fold-open or tablet window the sheet becomes
  a rail down the side. A dismissable tips card explains the cable button and where files land on first launch.
- **Settings** — denoise and its strength, sharpening and its strength, the cable button's double-press window, haptics, keep screen on while
  streaming, the stats overlay, the devices whose rotation and mirror the app has remembered (with "Forget"), and
  "Show tips again". Everything persists across restarts.
- **About & privacy** — the permission count, the source link, the MIT licence, attribution to the prior
  reverse-engineering projects, version and build id.

## Features (v0.3.1)
- Temporal denoise (toggle in both apps): adaptive frame blending that removes sensor grain when the probe is
  still and passes moving detail through. Snapshots save what is on screen.
- Optional sharpening (Settings on Android, a checkbox on desktop; off by default): a mild luma unsharp mask
  applied after denoise. What the camera actually delivers, why files are native 320x240 and never upscaled,
  and what sharpening does and does not do: `docs/image-quality.md`.
- Cable button: one press takes a photo, two within the window (configurable, default 1.5 s) start or stop a clip.
- Snapshot and recording feedback: shutter flash, a "Saved" toast with a thumbnail, a spinner while the encoder
  starts, a REC timer.
- Per-device orientation memory: rotate or mirror once and that device comes up that way next time.
- Material 3 with dynamic colour on Android 12+, light and dark. The launcher icon is Anthony's design (see `art/`).
- About & privacy screen (Android) and About dialog (desktop): permissions the app does not have, source link,
  MIT license, attribution to the prior reverse-engineering projects, version and build id.
- Free and open source. Sponsorship goes through the GitHub Sponsor button on the repository (which points at
  Ko-fi); the Android app itself contains no payment or donation links, because Google Play's Payments policy
  forbids in-app links to an external payment method (`docs/play-policy-audit.md`).
