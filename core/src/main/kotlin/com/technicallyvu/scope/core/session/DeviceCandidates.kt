/**
 * Picks which attached device a session loop should try next.
 *
 * Every poll used to take the *first* device some driver claimed and nothing else, which was fine
 * while only the vendor drivers existed: they match one USB id. [UvcBulkDriver][com.technicallyvu.scope.core.uvc.UvcBulkDriver]
 * matches any UVC function, so the first match can now be a laptop's built-in webcam, or any camera
 * whose `open` fails — and that device would shadow the real endoscope for as long as it stays
 * plugged in. Two rules stop it:
 *
 *  - **Skip what can never work.** A [UvcUnsupportedException] is permanent by definition (an
 *    isochronous-only endpoint, no MJPEG/YUY2 format, not a UVC device); its [DeviceRef] is
 *    remembered for the life of the process and never offered again.
 *  - **Rotate past what failed.** Any other open failure only moves the cursor: the next poll starts
 *    at the candidate *after* the one that failed, so a device with a transient problem costs one
 *    poll instead of blocking every other device forever. A device that did open is preferred on the
 *    following poll, so a reconnect goes straight back to the camera that was working.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: one instance per session loop, touched only from that loop.
