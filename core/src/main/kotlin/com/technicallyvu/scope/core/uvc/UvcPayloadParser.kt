/**
 * Turns a UVC bulk-transport byte stream into frames.
 *
 * The stream is a sequence of *payload transfers*, each `bHeaderLength` header bytes (byte 0) plus
 * data, and each no longer than the negotiated `dwMaxPayloadTransferSize` ([maxPayloadSize]). A
 * payload ends at that size or, earlier, at a short USB packet. Because a payload may be larger than
 * one bulk read, [accept] tracks how much of the current payload is still outstanding and parses a
 * header only when a new payload begins.
 *
 * Frame boundaries come from `bmHeaderInfo` (byte 1): bit 0 is the frame id, which toggles between
 * consecutive frames; bit 1 (EOF) marks the last payload of a frame; bit 6 (ERR) means the device
 * knows the frame is damaged, so we drop it. A frame id toggle also ends a frame, which is how a
 * stream with a lost EOF still makes progress.
 *
 * The in-progress frame is bounded: a device that never sets EOF and never toggles the frame id
 * would otherwise grow [frameBuf] without limit until the process dies. Past [frameCap] the frame
 * is discarded and the parser waits for the next frame boundary to resynchronise, so a wedged
 * stream costs a counter rather than the heap.
 *
 * Not thread-safe; owned by one read loop.
